ubdlib_complete_io_request() can be called in the io worker thread,
not in the ubdsrv queue thread(with the io_uring context for handling uring_cmd).

You can find ubd_runner.c in my libubd repo. There are many io worker
threads for each ubdsrv queue to handle IO requests.

Actually this idea comes from tcmu-runner. The data flow is:

1) in ubdsrv queue thread, io_uring_enter(): returns(IO reqs received from blk-mq)

2) in ubdsrv queue thread, ubdsrv_reap_requests(): iterate on each cqe(with an IO req),
   
   for READ/WRITE requests, ubd_aio_queue_io() to enqueue the IO req into a io_queue
   (each ubdsrv queue has one io_queue). This IO req's status is IO_HANDLING_ASYNC.
    
   for other simple(can be handled very quickly), 
   handle it right now and call ubdlib_complete_io_request()

3) in ubdsrv queue thread, ubdsrv_commit_and_fetch(): iterate on all IO slots per ubdsrv queue
   and setup sqe if one IO(IO completion) is ready to commit.
   
   Here, some IO slots are still IO_HANDLING_ASYNC so no sqe is generated for them.


4)  in ubdsrv queue thread, io_uring_enter(): submit all sqes and wait for cqes
    (io_uring_enter() will return after at least one IO req is received from blk-mq)
   
5) When 3) or 4) happens, at the same time in ubdsrv queue IO worker threads:
   each io worker thread try to deque and handle one IO req from io_queue per ubdsrv queue.
   
   After the IO worker handles the IO req(WRITE/READ), it calls ubdlib_complete_io_request()
   This function can mark this  IO req's status to ready to commit.

IO handling/completion and io_uring_enter() can happen at the same time.

Besides, io_uring_enter can:

1) block and wait for cqes until at least
one blk-mq req comes from queue_rq()

2) submit sqes(with last IO completion and next fetch)

so I have to consider how to notify io_uring about io completion 
after io_uring_enter() is slept(block and wait for cqes).

In current version of ubd_runner(an async libubd target), I try to use an "unblock"
io_uring_enter_timeout() and caller can set a timeout value for it.
So IO completions happen after io_uring_enter_timeout() call can be committed
by next io_uring_enter_timeout() call...

But this is a very ugly implementation 
because I may waste CPU on useless loops in ubdsrv queue thread if
blk-mq reqs do not income frequently.

You mentioned that eventfd may be helpful and I agree with you. :)
I can register an eventfd in io_uring after ubd_aio_queue_io() and write the eventfd
in  ubdlib_complete_io_request().

I will fix my code.

Ok, thanks for explanation.

Ok, since I allow users to config rq_max_blocks in libubd, 
it's users' responsibility to ensure length of user buffers
is at least rq_max_blocks.

Now I agree on your commit:
https://github.com/ming1/linux/commit/0a964a1700e11ba50227b6d633edf233bdd8a07d

Provide WRITE buffer in advance(when sending COMMIT_AND_FETCH) seems OK :)

Yes, this is like tcmu-runner's structure: a libtcmu and some target
Thanks, Ming.  Glad to co-work with you.

I will take your advice and improve libubd(the communication mechanism, maybe eventfd).

Ok, now libubd just focuses on performance.
I will try to add these error-handling methods.
