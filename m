I can't find a good writeup.  Adding Dave as he tends to do long
emails on topic like this so he might have one hiding somewhere.

True, we're only doing the nowait allocation for larger data
structures.  Which is a bit odd indeed.

Compared to a memory allocation it's not really doing all the much.
In the long run we really should move splitting discard bios down
the stack like we do for normal I/O anyway.

uniline?  I read that as unÑ–nline, but as it's not inline I don't
understand what you mean either.

I would have expected a uapi/linux/blkdev.h for it (and I'm kinda
surprised we don't have that yet).

We can't guaranteed uniqueness, but between the class, the direction,
and the argument size we get a pretty good one.  There is a reason
pretty much all ioctls added in the last 25 years are using this scheme.
