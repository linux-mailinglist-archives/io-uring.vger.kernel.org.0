I did more tests in a 64 cores machine.
test command is: nice -n -15 taskset -c 10-20 ./io_uring_echo_server -p 
8084 -f -n con_nr -l 1024
where -n means the number of connections, -l means size of load.
the results of tps and cpu usage under different IO pressure is:
(didn't find the way to make it look better, you may need a markdown
renderer :) )
tps

| feature | 1 | 2 | 1000 | 2000 | 3000 | 5800 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | 
-------- |
| ASYNC     |  123.000    |  295.203    |  67390.432   | 132686.361   | 
186084.114   | 319550.540    |
| ASYNC_HYBRID     |   122.000   |  299.401    |  168321.092   | 
188870.283  | 226427.166   |  371580.062   |


cpu

| feature | 1 | 2 | 1000 | 2000 | 3000 | 5800 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | 
-------- |
| ASYNC     |  0.3%    |   1.0%   |   62.5%  |  111.3%  |  198.3%  | 
420.9%   |
| ASYNC_HYBRID     |    0.3%  |   1.0%   |  360%   |  435.5%  |  516.6% 
  |   1100%  |

when con_nr is 1000 or more, we leveraged all the 10 cpus. hybrid is
surely better than async. when con_nr is 1 or 2, in theory async should
be better since it use more cpu resource, but it didn't, it is because
the copying in tw is not a bottleneck. So I tried bigger workload, no
difference. So I think it should be ok to just apply this feature on top
of IOSQE_ASYNC, for all pollable requests in all condition.
