Lets assume for the sake of discussion, had dm-mpath set a path to be
offline on ioctl errors, what would qemu do upon this error? blindly
retry? Until When? Or would qemu need to learn about the path tables in
order to know when there is at least one online path in order to retry?

What is the model that a passthru consumer needs to follow when
operating against a mpath device?
