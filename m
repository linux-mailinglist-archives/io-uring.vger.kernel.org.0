Indeed, the patch doesn't have any formal guarantees for propagation
to already inflight requests, so this extra unsynchronised check
doesn't change anything.

I'm still more —Åurious why we need RCU and extra complexity when
apparently there is no use case for that. If it's only about
initial initialisation, then as I described there is a much
simpler approach.
