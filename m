This patch series add an additional build system to liburing based
on the initial meson code proposed by Peter Eszlari <peter.eszlari@gmail.com>.
Since the initial proposal [1] in Februar 2021 I took up the meson code and
improved, maintained and made it available in the meson wrapdb [2].

Meson is a modern, fast and simple build system. Adoption started mainly in the
desktop space (Gnome, X11, Mesa) to replace autotools, but since then,
some low level projects (systemd, qemu) have switched to it too.

Using meson as build system has multiple advantages over the current custom
configure plus Makefile implementation:

* Out-of-source builds
* Seamlessly consumable by other projects using meson
* Meson generates the compile_commands.json database used i.e., by clangd
* Packagers can use a standardized and well known build system

The patch set requires at least meson version 0.53 satisfied by most distributions.

It has a working github bot integration equivalent to the current build system.

Myself and multiple other github users (Yury Zhuravlev @stalkberg, Tim-Philipp
MÃ¼ller @tp-m) [3] proposed to maintain the meson code once included.
For support regarding the meson code I am available via email or the mailing list.

This patch series cleanly applies to the current liburing master (1842b2a)
and includes all tests, examples and manpages available up to 1842b2a.
