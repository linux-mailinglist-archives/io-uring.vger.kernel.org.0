That's why I mentioned setting user_data, so can distinguish cqes.

No, only one.

again to be able to distinguish cqes, at least for debugging,
but I don't see how it can be not racy without it.

Right, I noticed. Was concerned about gen1 poll and its poll
remove.

This one sounds like that "85 gen 1 res 4"
is actually gen2 but with screwed user_data. I'd rather
double check that you set it right, and don't race
with multiple threads.

FWIW, submission queue filling is not synchronised by
liburing, users should do that.

There definitely may be a bug, but it's much more likely
lurking in your code.
