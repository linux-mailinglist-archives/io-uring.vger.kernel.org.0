The change looks reasonable, some changes needed around not blocking.
But you can't use the splice ops with a tty, you need to use an end of a
pipe. That's why you get -EBADF in your test program. I'm assuming you
didn't run the one you sent, because you're overwriting ->addr in that
one by setting splice_off_in after having assigned ->addr using the prep
function?

As a minimum, you'd need IO_WQ_WORK_MM I think for the async part of it,
if we need to block.

Various style issues in here too, like lines that are too long and
function braces need to go on a new line (and no braces for single
lines). If you want to move further with this, also split it into two
patches. The first should do the abstraction needed for splice.[ch] and
the second should be the io_uring change.
