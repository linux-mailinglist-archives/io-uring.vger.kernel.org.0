No we also and actually more commonly observe cancel returning -EALREADY and the
canceled read request never gets completed.

As shown in the log snippet I included below.

^- the cancel returned with -EALREADY but the cancelled read (the second
prepared read request) is never completed.

Thanks for your effort!
