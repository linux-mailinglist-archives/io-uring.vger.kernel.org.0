Hmm, I think we already discussed the same question before. Yes, it
does indeed support arbitrary number of connections. For what I was
saying above, the devmem TCP analogy would be attaching buffers to the
netlink socket instead of a tcp socket (that new xarray you added) when
you give it to user space. Then, you can close the connection after a
receive and the buffer you've got would still be alive.

That's pretty intuitive as well, with normal receives the kernel
doesn't nuke the buffer you got data into from a normal recv(2) just
because the connection got closed.

There should be a good bunch of tests in liburing if you follow
links in the cover letter, as well as added support to some
benchmark tools, kperf and netbench. Also, as mentioned, need to
add a simpler example to liburing, not sure why it was removed.
There will also be man pages, that's better to be done after
merging it since things could change.

Right

I'm not sure what you mean, but seems like the question comes from
the assumptions that it supports only one connection at a time,
which is not the case.
