Does this mean you stopped after the part where I cited 3 APIs including 
an old Linux interface (16+ years old), FreeBSD's implementation, and a 
Windows NT interface that all predate a hypothetical 14 year old? I 
guess this means modern Linux is less mature than both its' former -16 
year old self and a hypothetical 14 year old.
