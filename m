That's neat, but fwiw my concerns are mostly about what's
exposed to the user space.

Just like with jiffies, ktime_get() is wall clock time, but
uncomfortably much more expensive. Why not stime Jens dug up
last time?

I'm curious, is the plan to leave it only accessible via
procfs? It's not machine readable well, so should be quite
an annoyance parsing it every time.
