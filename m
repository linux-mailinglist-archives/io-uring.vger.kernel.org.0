I didn't send patch to remove the batch in ublk, such as, the following
line code:

ublk_queue_cmd():
	...
	if (!llist_add(&data->node, &ubq->io_cmds))
		return;
	...

But I did want to kill it given __io_req_task_work_add() can do batching
process, but we have to re-order request in this list, so can't remove it
now simply, see commit:

	7d4a93176e01 ("ublk_drv: don't forward io commands in reserve order")

Pavel must have misunderstood the following one as the batch removal:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20230427124414.319945-2-ming.lei@redhat.com/

	

thanks,
Ming
