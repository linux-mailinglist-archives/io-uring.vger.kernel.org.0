hi,

I spent some time to write v2, especially think about how to work
around task_work_add is not exported, so sorry for late response.

Absolutely agree with you, ebpf has strict programming rules,
I spent more time than I had thought at startup for support loop
target ebpf prog(ublk.bpf.c). Later I'll try to collaborate with my
colleagues, to see whether we can program their userspace logic
into ebpf prog or partially.

Yes, agree, but I didn't have much time to improve this yet.
Currently, I mainly try to use this feature on large ios, to
reduce memory copy overhead, which consumes much
cpu resource, our clients really hope we can reduce it.
