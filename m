Well, one problem that syzbot has to deal with is that to meet the kernel
community's needs, it can't require authentication to issue commands.

I understand that the current email-only interface, where all commands are Cc'ed
to the syzkaller-bug mailing list, makes that not a complete disaster currently.

I'd imagine that if anyone could just go to a web page and mess around with bug
statuses with no authentication, that might be more problematic.
