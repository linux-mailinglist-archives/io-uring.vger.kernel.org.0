As I said at the beginning of my reply, I agree with you that the
existing LSM controls are sufficient for restricting io_uring I/O
operations. That is not my concern here. The concern is: how to (and
do we need to) restrict triggering execution of *any* io_uring code in
kernel, *in addition to* restricting the actual io_uring operations.

In other words, "a real program doing a meaningful work with io_uring"
in this case would mean "an exploit for a real vulnerability in io_uring
code (in the current or any older kernel) which does not require an
access to io_uring operations to be exploited". I don't claim that such
vulnerabilities exist or are likely to be introduced in future kernels.
But I'm neither an io_uring expert nor, more importantly, a security
expert, so I cannot tell with confidence that they are not and we have
nothing to worry about here. So I'm interested in your and others'
opinion on that.

As an example, IIUC the inode_init_security_anon LSM hook already allows
us to prevent a process from obtaining a valid io_uring fd via
io_uring_setup(). But what if the process passes an invalid (unrelated)
fd to io_uring_register() or io_uring_enter()?

It looks like all that happens is: it will quickly fail the
io_is_uring_fops() check and return an error to userspace. So I suppose
we may reasonably assume that this particular simple code path will
remain bug-free and thus we don't need to worry about potential
vulnerabilities in this case. Even if so, can we assume that any other
code paths in io_uring that are reachable without passing the existing
permission checks are similarly trivial?
