The checks are already there in e.g. io_zcrx_recv_frag() to prevent
io_zcrx_iov_to_area() from being called on a devmem niov.

io_zcrx_copy_chunk() does not need a check because it is guaranteed to
only call io_zcrx_iov_to_area() on an io_uring niov. Copying happens in
two cases:

1. Not a niov
2. If offset is in the linearized part of an skb

Both cases do not apply to devmem so it is safe even in the case of an
skb rcvbuf with a mixture of non-niov, devmem niov and io_uring niov.

This is a fair ask. I'll address it in the next iteration.

We are already using io_uring specific code, though. The entire feature
requires the use of io_uring, and sockets that are set up for it can
only be (properly) consumed via io_uring specific functions. The return
path is no different.

Consuming via standard syscalls is still functionally correct. In that
case, the skbs when freed will go back to the page pool via the generic
paths e.g. napi_pp_put_page(). But in the intended fast path, returning
via the io_uring specific refill ring, there is no reason why we must
use the generic return functions.

Why insist on this? Both page/niov and devmem/io_uring niov are mutually
exclusive. There is no strong technical reason to not re-use
pp_ref_count.
