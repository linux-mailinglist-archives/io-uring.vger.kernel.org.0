Normally, userspace block device impementations need to copy data between
kernel block layer's io requests and userspace block device's userspace
daemon, for example, ublk and tcmu both have similar logic, but this
operation will consume cpu resources obviously, especially for large io.

There are methods trying to reduce these cpu overheads, then userspace
block device's io performance will be improved further. These methods
contain: 1) use special hardware to do memory copy, but seems not all
architectures have these special hardware; 2) sofeware methods, such as
mmap kernel block layer's io requests's data to userspace daemon [1],
but it has page table's map/unmap, tlb flush overhead, security issue,
etc, and it maybe only friendly to large io.

Add a new program type BPF_PROG_TYPE_UBLK for ublk, which is a generic
framework for implementing block device logic from userspace. Typical
userspace block device impementations need to copy data between kernel
block layer's io requests and userspace block device's userspace daemon,
which will consume cpu resources, especially for large io.

To solve this problem, I'd propose a new method, which will combine the
respective advantages of io_uring and ebpf. Add a new program type
BPF_PROG_TYPE_UBLK for ublk, userspace block device daemon process should
register an ebpf prog. This bpf prog will use bpf helper offered by ublk
bpf prog type to submit io requests on behalf of daemon process.
Currently there is only one helper:
    u64 bpf_ublk_queue_sqe(struct ublk_io_bpf_ctx *bpf_ctx,
		struct io_uring_sqe *sqe, u32 sqe_len, u32, fd)

This helper will use io_uring to submit io requests, so we need to make
io_uring be able to submit a sqe located in kernel(Some codes idea comes
from Pavel's patchset [2], but pavel's patch needs sqe->buf still comes
from userspace addr), and bpf prog initializes sqes, but does not need to
initializes sqes' buf field, sqe->buf will come from kernel block layer io
requests in some form. See patch 2 for more.

In example of ublk loop target, we can easily implement such below logic in
ebpf prog:
  1. userspace daemon registers an ebpf prog and passes two backend file
fd in ebpf map structureã€‚
  2. For kernel io requests against the first half of userspace device,
ebpf prog prepares an io_uring sqe, which will submit io against the first
backend file fd and sqe's buffer comes from kernel io reqeusts. Kernel
io requests against second half of userspace device has similar logic,
only sqe's fd will be the second backend file fd.
  3. When ublk driver blk-mq queue_rq() is called, this ebpf prog will
be executed and completes kernel io requests.

That means, by using ebpf, we can implement various userspace log in kernel.

From above expample, we can see that this method has 3 advantages at least:
  1. Remove memory copy between kernel block layer and userspace daemon
completely.
  2. Save memory. Userspace daemon doesn't need to maintain memory to
issue and complete io requests, and use kernel block layer io requests
memory directly.
  2. We may reduce the number of round trips between kernel and userspace
daemon, so may reduce kernel & userspace context switch overheads.

Test:
Add a ublk loop target: ublk add -t loop -q 1 -d 128 -f loop.file

fio job file:
  [global]
  direct=1
  filename=/dev/ublkb0
  time_based
  runtime=60
  numjobs=1
  cpus_allowed=1
  
  [rand-read-4k]
  bs=512K
  iodepth=16
  ioengine=libaio
  rw=randwrite
  stonewall


Without this patch:
  WRITE: bw=745MiB/s (781MB/s), 745MiB/s-745MiB/s (781MB/s-781MB/s), io=43.6GiB (46.8GB), run=60010-60010msec
  ublk daemon's cpu utilization is about 9.3%~10.0%, showed by top tool.

With this patch:
  WRITE: bw=744MiB/s (781MB/s), 744MiB/s-744MiB/s (781MB/s-781MB/s), io=43.6GiB (46.8GB), run=60012-60012msec
  ublk daemon's cpu utilization is about 1.3%~1.7%, showed by top tool.

From above tests, this method can reduce cpu copy overhead obviously.


TODO:
I must say this patchset is just a RFC for design.

1) Currently for this patchset, I just make ublk ebpf prog submit io requests
using io_uring in kernel, cqe event still needs to be handled in userspace
daemon. Once later we succeed in make io_uring handle cqe in kernel, ublk
ebpf prog can implement io in kernel.

2) ublk driver needs to work better with ebpf, currently I did some hack
codes to support ebpf in ublk driver, it only can support write requests.

3) I have not done much tests yet, will run liburing/ublk/blktests
later.

Any review and suggestions are welcome, thanks.
