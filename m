How does taking a measure for task runtime looks like? I expect it to
be a simple read of a variable inside task_struct, maybe with READ_ONCE,
in which case the overhead shouldn't be realistically measurable. Does
it need locking?

I'm looking at it as a generic feature for everyone, and the
accuracy behaviour is dependent on circumstances. High load
networking spends quite a good share of CPU in softirq, and
preemption would be dependent on config, scheduling, pinning,
etc.

That's a good point. It doesn't have to change unless you're
directly inferring the idle time parameter from those two
time values rather than using the ratio. E.g. a simple
bisection of the idle time based on the utilisation metric
shouldn't change. But that definitely raises the question
what idle_time parameter should exactly mean, and what is
more convenient for algorithms.
