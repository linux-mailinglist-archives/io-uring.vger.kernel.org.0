Heh, I overlooked this todo. The plan is to actually leave it
as is, it's by far the simplest way and doesn't really gets
into anyone's way as it's a slow path.

It doesn't because it can't (not breaking anything), which is a
problem as the page pool might never get destroyed. io_uring
doesn't change that, a buffer can't be reclaimed while anything
in the kernel stack holds it. It's only when it's given to the
user we can force it back out of there.

And it has to happen one way or another, we can't trust the
user to put buffers back, it's just devmem does that by temporarily
attaching the lifetime of such buffers to a socket.

If the pp/net maintainers abhor it, I could try to replace it
with some "inventive" solution, which most likely would need
referencing all io_uring zcrx requests, but otherwise I'd
prefer to leave it as is.

You can say it listens to the page pool being destroyed, exactly
what it's interesting in. Trying to catch the destruction of an
rx-queue is the same thing but with jumping more hops and indirectly
deriving that the page pool is killed.
