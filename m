Do you think that an the unkillable deadlock is still an issue with your 
changes in the v5 version of io_rsrc_ref_quiesce() I just sent out?

We're calling wait_for_completion_interruptible() so I assume it should 
be interruptible.  I think we'll then skip unmapping the buffers though, 
so it's not clear to me what the right solution is for the below 
scenario you raised in the first place:

task1: uring1 = create()
task2: uring2 = create()
task1: uring3 = create(share=uring2);
task2: uring4 = create(share=uring1);

task1: io_sqe_buffers_unregister(uring1)
task2: io_sqe_buffers_unregister(uring2)
