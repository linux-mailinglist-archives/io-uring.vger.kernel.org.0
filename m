Let me note to avoid being misread, that kind of prioritisation can
have place and that's fine, but that usually happens when you build
on top of older code or user base sizes are much different. And
again, theoretically dmabuf_genpool_chunk_owner could be common code,
i.e. if you want to use dmabuf you need to use the structure
regardless of the provider of choice, and it'll do all dmabuf
handling. But the current chunk owner goes beyond that, and
would need some splitting if someone tries to have that kind of
an abstraction.

True enough, I drew the line when it was convenient, io_uring
needs an extendible abstraction that binds net_iovs, and we'll
also have several different sets of net_iovs, so it fell onto
the object holding the net_iov array as the most natural option.
In that sense, we could've had that binding pointing to an
allocated io_zcrx_area, which would then point further into
io_uring, but that's one extra indirection.

As an viable alternative I don't like that much, instead of
trying to share struct net_iov_area, we can just make struct
struct net_iov::owner completely provider dependent and make
it void *, providers will be allowed to store there whatever
they wish.

That's done the typical way everything in the kernel and just
inheritance works. When you get into devmem.c the page pool
callbacks, you for sure know that net_iov's passed are devmem's,
nobody should ever take one net_iov's ops and call it with a
second net_iov without care, the page pool follows it.

When someone wants to operate with devmem net_iov's but doesn't
have a callback it has to validate the origin as tcp.c now does
in 5/15. The nice part is that this patch changes types, so all
such places either explicitly listed in this patch, or it has to
pass through one of the devmem.h helpers, which is yet trivially
checkable.
