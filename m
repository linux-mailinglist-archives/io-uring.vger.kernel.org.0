There's no way to cancel file/bdev related IO, and there likely never
will be. That's basically the only exception, everything else can get
canceled pretty easily. Many things can be written on why that is the
case, and they have (myself included), but it boils down to proper
hardware support which we'll likely never have as it's not a well tested
path. For other kind of async IO, we're either waiting in poll (which is
trivially cancellable) or in an async thread (which is also easily
cancellable). For DMA+irq driven block storage, we'd need to be able to
reliably cancel on the hardware side, to prevent errant DMA after the
fact.

None of this is really io_uring specific, io_uring just suffers from the
same limitations as others would (or are).

If you see that, that is most certainly a bug. While bdev/reg file IO
can't really be canceled, they all have the property that they complete
in finite time. Either the IO completes normally in a "short" amount of
time, or a timeout will cancel it and complete it in error. There are no
unbounded execution times for uncancellable IO.

There is no infrastructure, I'm fraid. ki_cancel() is just a random hook
that nobody (outside of USB gadget??) ever implemented or used.

ki_cancel is a non-starter, it doesn't even work for the single case
that it's intended for, and I'm actually surprised it hasn't been
removed yet. It's one of those things that someone added a hook for, but
never really grew into something that is useful.
