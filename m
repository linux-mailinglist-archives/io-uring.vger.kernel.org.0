I'm sorry but happy to inform you about my success in getting those
funds transferred under the cooperation of a new partner from Vietnam

the whole situations. Presently i'm in Vietnam for investment projects
with my own share of the total sum. Meanwhile, i didn't forget your
past efforts and attempts to assist me in transferring those funds
despite that it failed us some how.

Now contact my secretary  her name is Ms.Aisha Atan on her e-mail
address here: ( aishaatansecretary2@gmail.com ) Ask her to
send you the total of ( Hundred thousand united states dollars,
$100.000.00 ) which i kept for your compensation for all the past
efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter. I appreciated your
efforts at that time very much. so feel free and get in touched with
my secretary Ms.Aisha Atan and instruct her where to send the amount
to you. Please do let me know immediately you receive it so that we
can share the joy after all the sufferer at that time.

In the moment, I=E2=80=99m very busy here because of the investment project=
s
which I and the new partner are having at hand, finally, remembers
that I had forwarded instruction to the secretary on your behalf to
receive that money, so feel free to get in touch with Ms.Aisha
Atan.She will send the amount to you without any delay.

Regards
