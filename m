Figured out, it is still one userspace issue.

For nbd request sent to server, the cqe could come after the
ublk io request is completed which is triggered by nbd reply
from server, then if new ublk io req is submitted to same slot, the
new data length and op code could be read in nbd_send_req_done(),
and the warning is triggered.
