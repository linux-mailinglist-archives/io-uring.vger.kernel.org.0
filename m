If we move io_kiocb out avoiding one indirection would be very easy
indeed.  But I think that just invites abuse.  Note that we also have
at least one and potentially more indirections in this path.  The
request rq_end_io handler is a guranteed one, and the IPI or softirq
for the request indirectin is another one.  So my plan was to look
into having an io_uring specific hook in the core block code to
deliver completions directly to the right I/O uring thread.  In the
best case that should allow us to do a single indirect call for
the completion instead of 4 and a pointless IPI/softirq.

Yes, there is about two of them that would then need to be open coded
using __io_req_complete.

Do we still want a union for cmd and document it to say what
opcode it is for?
