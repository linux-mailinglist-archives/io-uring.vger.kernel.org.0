This patch just introduces the API, for easier reviewing (and handling
some patch dependencies).  Patch 8 adds the initial implementation.

I just copied EXPORT_SYMBOL from io_uring.c, and have no preference
as to which export variant is used.

I was testing against several drivers, which were loadable modules for
ease of development.  For example, Broadcomâ€™s in-tree bnxt driver does not
(currently) have steering support, so testing was against their external
driver package while waiting for the features to land upstream.
