That's widespread, last time I looked into it no amount of patching
saved io_uring and tasks being killed by the oom reaper under memory
pressure.

"Hand code" if you wish, but you can just ignore it

I think that would be overkill, we don't need it for just these
commands, and it's only adds pain with probing the header with
autotools or so. If there is a future vision for it I'd say we
can drop a patch on top.

which is likely because some people insisted on it and not because
the scheme is so great that everyone became acolytes. Not to mention
only 256 possible "types" and the endless mess of sharing them and
trying to find a range to use. I'll convert to have less headache,
but either way we're just propagating the problem into the future.
