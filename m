Right, it's a heuristic that's often wrong and costs energy when it
triggers is what I was trying to say.

Maybe not full swing, but the relatively high rate_limit_us and TICK_NSEC
found on Android deivces does indeed lead to occasional boosting periods
even for 'infrequent'/unrelated wakeups.

That should be "[...] in task placement for HMP", you're right.
Essentially if we were to consider a task to be 100% of capacity boost-worthy,
we need to consider that at task placement. Now we cap out at the local CPU,
which might be rather small. (~10% of the biggest CPU on mobile).
Logically this argument (a CAS argument essentially), should probably come
before the EAS one to make more sense.

Unfortunately the lingering (or to use a term with less negative connotation:
holding) almost is a necessity, too, as described in the cover-letter.
If we only boost at enqueue (and immediately scale down on dequeue) we lose
out massively, as the interrupt isn't boosted and we have to run at the lower
frequency for the DVFS transition delay (even if on x86 that may be close to
negligible). IMO this is the main reason why the mechanism can't evolve (into
something like a per-task strategy).
Even a per-task strategy would need to a) set a timer in case the iowait
period is too long and b) remove boost from prev_cpu if enqueued somewhere
else.

Agreed, this can be argued about (and also isn't a huge problem in
practice).

And the lines between those become more and more blurry, see the GFX
regression. There's very few free lunches up for grabs these days, if
you're boosting performance on X, you're likely paying for it on Y.
That is fine as long as boosting X is deliberate which iowait boosting
very much is not.

Thanks Rafael, you brought up some good points!
