What prevents anyone from just sending an email to the syzbot issue email
and modifying it?

I love using email as it's easier when you're replying anyway, but the
problem is that I can never remember the magic incantations that I need
to send it. So I invariably click the link ANYWAY to find out what to
reply, and now it's more hassle using email. Maybe we can solve this by
making the email footer actually contain the common responses? Then
I would not have to click, switch desktops, scroll to find, copy part
of it, switch desktops, paste into email, open terminal to generate
the rest, switch back to email, paste in, click send. It really isn't
a very pleasurable experience.
