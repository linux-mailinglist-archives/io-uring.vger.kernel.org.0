It's hardly interesting, it's _exactly_ the same thing devmem TCP
does by attaching the lifetime of buffers to a socket's xarray,
which requires custom behaviour. Maybe I wasn't clear on one thing
though, it's accounting from the page pool's perspective. Those are
user pages, likely still mapped into the user space, in which case
they're not going to be destroyed.

I don't get it, what "this"? If it's refill queue, that's because
I don't like actively returning buffers back via syscall / setsockopt
and trying to transfer them into the napi context (i.e.
napi_pp_put_page) hoping it works / cached well.

If "this" is IO_ZC_RX_UREF, it's because we need to track when a
buffer is given to the userspace, and I don't think some kind of
map / xarray in the hot path is the best for performance solution.

There couldn't be any net_iov at this point not belonging to
the current io_uring instance / etc. Same with devmem TCP,
devmem callbacks can't be called for some random net_iov, the
only place you need to explicitly check is where it comes
from generic path to a devmem aware path like that patched
chunk in tcp.c

I'll take a look, might remove it.

Ok, I can add a page pool helper for that.

I get what you're trying to say about not touching internals,
I agree with that, but I can't share the sentiment about debugging.
It's a pretty specific api, users running io_uring almost always
write directly to io_uring and we solve it. If happens it's not
the case, please do redirect the issue.

Doing 1 buffer per callback wouldn't be scalable at speeds
we're looking at.
