I just already described it above but somewhat less detailed. FWIW,
page_pool_dma_map_page() + page_pool_set_pp_info() has to be combined
into a single function as separately they don't make a good public
API. I can change it this way, but ultimately there is no much
difference, it needs to export functions that io_uring can use.
Does it make a better API? I doubt it, and it can be changed later
anyway. Let's not block the patchset for minor bikeshedding.

Right, which is why it's used for usual buffer refcounting that
page pool / net stack recognises. It's also not a problem to extend
it for performance reasons, those are internals and can be changed
and there are ways to change it.

Please read again why user pages can't be passed directly,
if you take a look at struct page and where pp_ref_count and
other bits are, you'll find a huge union.

Removing __always_inline from a function deemed hot enough to need
the attribute is not a good idea, not in an unrelated feature
patchset. FWIW, it's not a new practice either. If maintainers will
insist on removing it I'll do.
