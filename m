block layer doesn't have knowledge to handle that, io_uring knows the
application is exiting, and can help to reap the events.

But the big question is that if there is really IO timeout for virtio-blk.
If there is, the reap done in io_uring may never return and cause other
issue, so if it is done in io_uring, that can be just thought as sort of
improvement.

The real bug fix is still in device driver, usually only the driver timeout
handler can provide forward progress guarantee.

Then looks not safe to support IO polling for virtio-blk, maybe disable it
at default now until the virtio-blk spec starts to support IO abort?
