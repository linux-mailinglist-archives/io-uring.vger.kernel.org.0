Yeah I agree, that's assuming we can make the drain more efficient. Just
hand waving on possible use cases :-)

But you can easily do that with IOSQE_NO_CQE, in fact that's what I did
to test this. The chain will have IOSQE_NO_CQE | IOSQE_IO_LINK set on
all but the last request.

My box with the optane2 is out of commission, apparently, cannot get it
going today. So I had to make do with my laptop, which does about ~600K
random read IOPS. I don't see any difference there, using polled IO,
using 4 link deep chains (so 1/4th the CQEs). Both run at around
611-613K IOPS.
