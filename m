In addition we want to limit the SQEs to use only the registered fd and buffers.

Thanks for your feedback, I just sent v2 before I read this e-mail.

Do you think it's better to have everything in seccomp instead of adding
the restrictions in io_uring (the patch isn't very big)?

With seccomp, would it be possible to have different restrictions for two
instances of io_uring in the same process?
I suppose it should be possible using BPF filters.

Thanks,
Stefano
