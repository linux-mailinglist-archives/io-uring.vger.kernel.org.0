I think what you'd want is two (or more) io_uring ops being really
busy and measuring dcache pressure while running that test. I don't
think this is very feasible to accurately measure, and I also don't
think that is an issue. The split into hot/cold parts of the op
definitions is obviously a good idea. For ideal setups, we'll never
be using the cold part at all, and having a smaller op definition
for the fast path is always going to be helpful.
