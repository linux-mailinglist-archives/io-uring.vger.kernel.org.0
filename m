So, I'm currently working on rebasing your work onto the tag
'for-5.13/io_uring-2021-04-27'. So if you already have some branch on
this, just let me know to save the work.

When looking at the current implementation, when can only perform the
attachment once and there is no "append eBPF". While this is probably OK
for code, for eBPF maps, we will need some kind of append eBPF map.

So besides an eBPF-Progam ID, we would also pass an ID for an eEBF map
in the SQE.

One thought that came to my mind: Why do we have to register the eBPF
programs and maps? We could also just pass the FDs for those objects in
the SQE. As long as there is no other state, it could be the userspaces
choice to either attach it or pass it every time. For other FDs we
already support both modes, right?

If we make it possible to pass some FD to an synchronization object
(e.g. semaphore), this might do the trick to support both modes at the interface.

But surely this would hurt a lot as we would have to manage not only
eBPF programs, but also eBPF processes. While this is surely possible, I
don't know if it is really suitable for a high-performance interface
like io_uring. But, don't know about the state.

Using Spinlocks between kernel and userspace just feels wrong, very
wrong. But it might be an alternate route to synchronization

I like the notion of orthogonality with this route. Perhaps, we don't
need to have user-invisible CQs but it can be enough to address the CQ
of another uring in my SQE as the sink for the resulting CQE.

Downside with that idea would be that the user has to setup another 
ring with SQ and CQ, but only the CQ is used.

From looking at the code: This is not yet the case, or?

When taking a step back, this is nearly a io_uring_enter(minwait=N)-SQE
with an attached eBPF callback, or? At that point, we are nearly full
circle.

So, let's make a little collection about the (potential) information
that our poor SQE has to hold. Thereby, FDs should be registrable and
addressible by an index.

- FD to eBPF program
- FD to eBPF map
- FD to synchronization object during the execution
- FD to foreign CQ for waiting on N CQEs

That are a lot of references to other object for which we would have
to extend the registration interface.

You convinced me that an eBPF map as a context is the more canonical way
of doing it by achieving the same degree of flexibility.

Either way, from a researcher perspective, we can just allow it and look
how it can performs.
