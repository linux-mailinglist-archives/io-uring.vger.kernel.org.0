I referred to nothing particular, just a way userspace finds a new index,
can be round robin or "index==fd".

As mentioned, it should be slightly more efficient to have a small table,
cache misses. Also, it's allocated with kvcalloc() so if it can't be
allocate physically contig memory it will set up virtual memory.

So, if the userspace has some other way of indexing files, small tables
are preferred. For instance if it operates with 1-2 files, or stores files
in an array and the index in the array may serve the purpose, or any other
way. Also, additional memory for those who care.

If they intend to use a big number of files that's the way to go. They
can unregister/register if needed, usual grow factor=2  should make
it workable.

We may consider fast growing as a separate feature if really needed,
either as you did it, or even better doing it explicitly and separately
from updates.

That's fine as long as it's optional
