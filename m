That was exactly my idea:  make it possible to register them
optionally.

I also think that registering the eBPF program FD could be made
optionally, since this would be similar to other FD references that are
submitted to io_uring.

So, we will have the regular user_data attribute there. So why add
another potential argument to the program, besides passing an eBPF map?

My feeling would be the following: In any case, at submission we have to
resolve the SQE references to a 'bpf_prog *', if this is done via a
registered program in io_ring_ctx or via calling 'bpf_prog_get_type' is
only a matter of the frontend.

The only difference would be the reference couting. For registered
bpf_progs, we can increment the refcounter only once. For unregistered,
we would have to increment it for every SQE. Don't know if the added
flexibility is worth the effort.

I was thinking further about this. And, really I could not come up with
a proper user-space visible 'object' that we can grab with an FD to
attach this semantic to as futexes come in form of a piece of memory.

So perhaps, we would do something like

    // alloc 3 groups
    io_uring_register(fd, REGISTER_SYNCHRONIZATION_GROUPS, 3);

    // submit a synchronized SQE
    sqe->flags |= IOSQE_SYNCHRONIZE;
    sqe->synchronize_group = 1;     // could probably be restricted to uint8_t.

When looking at this, this could generally be a nice feature to have
with SQEs, or? Hereby, the user could insert all of his SQEs and they
would run sequentially. In contrast to SQE linking, the order of SQEs
would not be determined, which might be beneficial at some point.

In the context you mean: there could be a pointer to user-memory and the
bpf program calls futex_wait?

Would this be done at creation time or by registering them? I think that
creation time would be sufficient and it would ease the housekeeping. In
that case, we could get away with making all CQs equal in size and only
read out the number of the additional CQs from the io_uring_params.

When adding a sqe->cq_idx: Do we have to introduce an IOSQE_SELET_OTHER
flag to not break userspace for backwards compatibility or is it
sufficient to assume that the user has zeroed the SQE beforehand?

However, I like the idea of making it a generic field of SQEs.

I was just joking: With a minwait=N-like field in the eBPF-SQE, we can
mimic the behavior of io_uring_enter(minwait=N) but with an SQE. On the
result of that eBPF-SQE we can now actually wait with io_uring_enter(..)
