As ____sys_recvmsg() has this:

        if (sock->file->f_flags & O_NONBLOCK)
                flags |= MSG_DONTWAIT;

The difference is that we don't block in__sys_recvmsg() within a worker thread,
but instead handle it via io_arm_poll_handler()?

I think it should be documented, but I guess it might be useful to keep a way
to switch between the 3 available modes in order to find the one that
performances best depending on the workload.
