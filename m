Definitely, and I did do exactly that.

See the cover-letter part on per-task iowait boosting, specifically:

v1 per-task io boost

OSPM24 discussion iowait boosting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSQGEsSziZ4

These are the main issues with transforming the existing mechanism into
a per-task attribute.
Almost unsolvable is: Does reducing "iowait pressure" (be it per-task or per-rq)
actually improve throughput even (assuming for now that this throughput is
something we care about, I'm sure you know that isn't always the case, e.g.
background tasks). With MCQ devices and some reasonable IO workload that is
IO-bound our iowait boosting is often just boosting CPU frequency (which uses
power obviously) to queue in yet another request for a device which has essentially
endless pending requests. If pending request N+1 arrives x usecs earlier or
later at the device then makes no difference in IO throughput.
If boosting would improve e.g. IOPS (of that device) is something the block layer
(with a lot of added infrastructure, but at least in theory it would know what
device we're iowaiting on, unlike the scheduler) could tell us about. If that is
actually useful for user experience (i.e. worth the power) only userspace can decide
(and then we're back at uclamp_min anyway).
(The above all assumes that iowait even means "is waiting for block IO and
about to send another block IO" which is far from reality.)

Thanks Quentin for getting involved, your input is very much appreciated!
