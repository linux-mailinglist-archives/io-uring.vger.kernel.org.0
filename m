Our app handles IOs itself with network(RPC) and internal memory pool
so UBLK_IO_REFETCH_REQ
(actually I think it is like NEED_GET_DATA in the earlist version :) )
is helpful to us because we can assign data buffer address AFTER the app
gets one IO requests(WRITE, with data size) and we avoid PRE-allocating buffers.

Besides, adding UBLK_IO_REFETCH_REQ is helpful to build ublk driver as module
It seems like kernel developers do not want a built-in driver. :)

Maybe your app is different from ours(you may not need to handle IOs by yourelf).
