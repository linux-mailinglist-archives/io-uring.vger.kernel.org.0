BLK_QC_T_* are block cookies, they are only valid in the block layer.
Only the poll handler called should have to deal with them, inside
their f_op->iopoll() handler. It's simply passed from the queue to
the poll side.

So no, io_uring shouldn't have to deal with them at all.

The problem, as I see it, is if the block layer returns BLK_QC_T_NONE
and the IO was actually queued and requires polling to be found. We'd
end up with IO timeouts for handling those requests, and that's not a
good thing...

Pretty sure that's a leftover from when the attempts was made to pass
back -EAGAIN inline instead of through the bio end_io handler.
