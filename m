That probably should be done in any case, since I don't think
IOSQE_ASYNC is useful on the eventfd read for you. But I'm trying to
narrow down _why_ it fails, it could be a general issue in how
cancelations are processed for sudden exit. Which would explain why it
only shows up for the kill -9 case.

Anyway, digging into it :-)
