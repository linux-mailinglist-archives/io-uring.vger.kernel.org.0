I simply read your mail:

X-Date: Fri, 13 Oct 2023 17:43:54 +0200
X-URI: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHC9VhQcSY9q=wVT7hOz9y=o3a67BVUnVGNotgAvE6vK7WAkBw@mail.gmail.com

"I'm not too concerned, either approach works for me, the important bit
 is moving to an atomic_t/refcount_t so we can protect ourselves
 against the race.  The patch looks good to me and I'd like to get this
 fix merged."

including that "The patch looks good to me [...]" part before I sent out
the application message:

It's before the weekend and we're about to release -rc6. This thing
needs to be in -next, you said it looks good to you in a prior mail. I'm
not sure why I'm receiving this mail apart from the justified
clarification about -stable although that was made explicit in your
prior mail as well.

Thanks for providing an explicit ACK.
