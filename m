I would love to have this discussion; that's something which has been on 
my personal to-do list for a long time, and io_uring might finally be a 
solution to it.

Or, alternatively, looking at CDL for NVMe; that would be an alternative 
approach.
Maybe it's even worthwhile to schedule a separate meeting for it.
