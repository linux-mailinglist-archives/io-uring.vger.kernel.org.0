So summarize my proposal: I want io_uring to support implicit
synchronization by sequentialization at submit time. Doing this would
avoid the overheads of locking (and potentially sleeping).

So the problem that I see with a userspace solution is the following:
If I want to sequentialize an SQE with another SQE that was submitted
waaaaaay earlier, the usual IOSQE_IO_LINK cannot be used as I cannot the
the link flag of that already submitted SQE. Therefore, I would have to
wait in userspace for the CQE and submit my second SQE lateron.

Especially if the goal is to remain in Kernelspace as long as possible
via eBPF-SQEs this is not optimal.

If we extend the semantic of IOSEQ_IO_LINK instead of introducing a new
flag, we should be able to limit the problem, or?

- With synchronize_group=0, the usual link-the-next SQE semantic could
  remain.
- While synchronize_group!=0 could expose the described synchronization
  semantic.

Thereby, the overhead is at least hidden behind the existing check for
IOSEQ_IO_LINK, which is there anyway. Do you consider IOSQE_IO_LINK=1
part of the hot path?
