That is actually easy, but I'd suggest you to do it, and I can apply
the patch on ublksrv tree once it is ready. It is also one good chance
for you to understand the recent change of libublksrv.

I have written one loop based on io_uring, which performs very well.

The eventfd interface is actually for existed project which can't use
io_uring or io_uring may not implement the function, that should be
your use case.

Exactly, the pthread of demo_event_real_io_handler_fn is for handling
io from /dev/ublkbN.

That can be done, but sync among these pthreads have to be dealt with
well.

The example of demo_event.c is enough for implementing the loop/event.


Thanks,
