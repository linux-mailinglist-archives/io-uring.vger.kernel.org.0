Even though Jakub didn't comment on this patch, but he definitely
wasn't fond of giving all those headers to non net/ users. I guess
I can't please everyone. One middle option is to make the page
pool helper more granular, i.e. taking care of one netmem at
a time, and moving the loop to io_uring, but I don't think it
changes anything.

the page argument provides a mapping, the netmem gives the object
where the mapping is set. netmem could be the same as the page
argument, but I don't think it's inherently wrong, and it's an
internal helper anyway. I can entirely copy paste the function, I
don't think it's anyhow an improvement.

Mina, as explained it before, I view it rather as an abstraction
that helps with finer grained control over memory and extending
it this way, I don't think it's such a stretch, and it doesn't
change much for the networking stack overall. Not fitting into
devmem TCP category doesn't make it weird.

It's a user page, we can't make assumptions about it, we can't
reuse space in struct page like for pp refcounting (unlike when
it's allocated by the kernel), we can't use the normal page
refcounting.

If that's the direction people prefer, we can roll back to v1 from
a couple years ago, fill skbs fill user pages, attach ubuf_info to
every skb, and whack-a-mole'ing all places where the page could be
put down or such, pretty similarly what net_iov does. Honestly, I
thought that reusing common infra so that the net stack doesn't
need a different path per interface was a good idea.

I only added it here to cast away __always_inline since it's used in
a slow / setup path. It shouldn't change the binary, but I'm not a huge
fan of leaving the hint for the code where it's not needed.
